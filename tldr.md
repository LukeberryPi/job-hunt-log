## tldr

- tech + finance firm
good chat with tech lead. salary range was inside of expectations. good outlook. no feedback yet.

- consulting firm
HR liked my profile. tech lead i was supposed to talk to cancelled our call minutes before it was going to happen. bad first impression, plus they use teams. re-scheduled our talk.
