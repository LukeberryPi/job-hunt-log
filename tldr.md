- tech + finance firm
good chat with tech lead. salary range was inside of expectations. good outlook. no feedback yet.

- consulting firm
HR liked my profile. manager i was supposed to talk to cancelled our call minutes before it was going to happen. bad first impression, plus they use teams. re-scheduled our talk. i talked to her the following week, to my dismay. unprofessional and hectic. i hope i have better options.

- exciting brazilian fintech
super cool company. very modern and small. interesting stack. very challenging backend work to be done. unfortunately not aligned with my strengths.

- international position
got referred straight to a tech recruiter by a friend. i fit all 11 qualifications. except time of experience, which they ask for 4+. I have around 2.5. i got instantly filtered out. i tried to argue my case, let's see how it goes.
