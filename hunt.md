## hunt

i asked to be sent off from my last company in May/2023. it happened in June/2023. i have been enjoying the brazilian benefits of a salaried worker (basically 60% of my salary for another 4 months + 3 salaries upfront). granted i worked for > 1 year in that position + being dismissed assures me extra benefits.

when October/2023 hit, the time came to search for a new opportunity. i kicked things off with [this tweet](https://x.com/LukeberryPi/status/1708965236965769325?s=20), enjoying the twitter network i built for myself to get some referrals and positions recommended to me.

what happened the most was receiving links of positions to apply to via twitter dm. some referrals, some regular links. i applied to most. some in in platforms such as indeed, some in internal platforms.

one of the contacts that surprised me was from a tech lead that didn't follow me, and wanted to schedule a chat for an open position at a tech + finance company. this had me really excited.

the call went well. he is a very direct guy, with 10+ years of experience. he made meaningful questions such as: 
- what was the biggest technical challenge you faced in your projects in the last firm?
- what would you change about the code of the project you worked on previously?
- what was the payment gateway you used at the last company?

when i showed him my personal projects, [@phived](https://phived.com) and [@css2wind](https://css2wind.com), he pointed out that a strong quality i have is being able to design + code frontend. he said especially for early stage startups, that can be a strong positive. i have heard this combo being referred to as Design Engineer. i might invest in this title.

something i could have done better was have the answers rehearsed and ready for the obvious questions listed above. also, asking how many more steps in the hiring process and how does code get evaluated (white board algos || take-home projects)

as of writing this, i have received no feedback from our initial chat. but i'm hopeful, since conversation went well and my salary range was well received. for this position i asked for BRL 7000 / month.

a few days later i received a referral from twitter DMs to work at a consulting firm. a follower sent me a link to the company website and said that he could forward my contacts to HR for a talk. i shared my info and talked to HR via phone call (a first).

the talk was less technical than expected, and was pretty quick. main points were: technologies previously worked on, salary expectations, where do you see yourself in 5 years professionally and how soon i could start at the job. i asked for BRL 7500 / month. he was pleased with my answers and my profiles and scheduled a video-conference with a tech lead a couple days away.

when the day of said interview came, the manager cancelled 2 minutes before the scheduled time. big red flag ([extra context](https://x.com/LukeberryPi/status/1712107141517959373?s=20)). also they use teams. even bigger red flag. she apologised and we are currently looking for a new date to reschedule.

i just interviewed with her. she felt unmotivated. she made many questions that i had previously answered while talking to the HR guy. one of the redundant questions was salary range, which she was unhappy with and acted quite unprofessionally about. turns out she barely had technical questions and this was a v2 of the HR talk. i am feeling pretty negative about this position. hope i have better options.

i had another meeting today! talked to a person i admire a lot. he's the co-founder of a brazilian startup called Cumbuca. it is a fintech with solutions in splitting payments with friends/family. excellent chat. unfortunately, this position is closer to a Mid-level Backend Engineer. they use elixir, react native, typescript and are < 25 employees at the moment. even though this isn't exactly my profile, i accessed the code challenge for the position to play around with and maybe learn some elixir. this is definitely a company i would work for in the future.
